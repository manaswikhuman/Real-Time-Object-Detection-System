# Real-Time-Object-Detection-System
Built a real-time object detection pipeline using deep learning and computer vision techniques to identify and track objects from live video streams with optimized inference performance.
## Tech Stack
- Python
- OpenCV
- YOLO (Ultralytics)
- NumPy

## Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the detection script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   *Note: Press 'q' to exit the video stream.*
